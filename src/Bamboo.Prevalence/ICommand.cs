namespace Bamboo.Prevalence
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Models a command object. Command objects are
	/// the entities that apply changes to the 
	/// state of a prevalent system. If your object doesn't
	/// change the state of the system you should consider
	/// implementing it as a query object (<see cref="IQuery"/>).
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// In addition to implementing this interface
	/// the command object must also be serializable
	/// (command objects are written to a log before execution).
	/// <br />
	/// Also, the use of explicit interface implementation is
	/// advised, see the example below. Explicit interface
	/// implementation prevents a user from accidentally calling
	/// the Execute method.
	/// </remarks>
	/// <example>
	/// <code language="C#">
	/// [Serializable]
	/// public class AddCommand : ICommand
	/// {
	///		private int _amount;
	///		
	///		public AddCommand(int amount)
	///		{
	///			_amount = amount;
	///		}
	///		
	///		/// The explicit interface implementation
	///		/// shown here is preferred since 
	///		/// it prevents the user from calling
	///		/// the Execute method directly.
	///		object ICommand.Execute(object system)
	///		{
	///			((AddingSystem)system).Add(amount);
	///		}
	///	}
	/// </code>
	/// </example>
	public interface ICommand
	{
		/// <summary>
		/// Executes the command logic.
		/// </summary>		
		/// <param name="system">the prevalent system</param>
		/// <returns>command defined return value</returns>
